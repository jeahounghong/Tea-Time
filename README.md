# Tee-Time

Tee-Time is a full stack web application where users can connect with other users to find local games happening around their area.

## Background and Overview 
One of the biggest barriers to entry for people looking to pick up the game of golf is finding people to play with.

Tee-Time is a platform for finding and building local groups to get together for a round. This full stack web application will also let users easily keep track of their upcoming tee times and groups they are a part of.

Our application will consist of:
* A user dashboard, with a calendar of upcoming events and a list of their groups
* A feed page to display open events and public groups for users to join
* Google Maps API to see events near you on the map
* Web chat feature within groups/events to discuss details with your party
